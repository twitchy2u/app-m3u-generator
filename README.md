# ⭐ FAST Service M3U Playlist Generator

![Build Status](https://github.com/BuddyChewChew/app-m3u-generator/actions/workflows/generate_playlists.yml/badge.svg)

This repository automatically generates M3U playlist files for various free ad-supported streaming television (FAST) services using a Python script and GitHub Actions. The playlists include embedded EPG (Electronic Program Guide) information via the `url-tvg` tag in the M3U header.

## ▶️ How It Works

1. **Data Fetching:** A Python script (`generate_playlists.py`) fetches the latest channel data from reliable upstream sources (primarily [i.mjh.nz](https://i.mjh.nz)).
2. **M3U Generation:** The script parses the data and utilizes the `jmp2.uk` proxy to ensure Pluto and Samsung TV Plus streams remain functional in standard IPTV players.
3. **GitHub Action:** A scheduled workflow runs daily (03:00 UTC).
4. **The TiviMate Fix:** The workflow dynamically injects the full GitHub Raw URL into the Tubi M3U header. This ensures that players like TiviMate can find the `tubi_epg.xml` guide without manual configuration.
